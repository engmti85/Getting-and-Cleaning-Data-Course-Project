# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
  
  Read Train, Test and Subject files and define names.
  
  Merge all three datasets.
  
  Keep only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.
  
  Name the activities in the data set using the activity labels file.
  
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  
  Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
