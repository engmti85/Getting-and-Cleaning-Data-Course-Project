This is the  code book for the getting and cleaning data course project 
 
Identifiers are as follows:
 
subject - The ID of the test subject

activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. 
 

Activity levels: 
 
WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
